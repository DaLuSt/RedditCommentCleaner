    Network security configuration.

    - cleartextTrafficPermitted="false"  — blocks plain HTTP app-wide.
    - Only the system certificate store is trusted (no user-installed CAs).
      This protects OAuth tokens from interception via rogue user CAs.

    Certificate pinning is intentionally omitted: Reddit rotates TLS
    certificates periodically and pinning without an automated update
    process would cause the app to stop working after a rotation.
